# PROJECT DETAILS

### Author: Veronica Munoz Mendoza

### Project Summary: 
This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a COVID-19 dataset using Python. 
The insights derived from the analysis will be utilised to create a comprehensive dashboard in Excel.

**Tools:**

	•	VS Code
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Python
	•	Excel

**Source:** The COVID-19 dataset is maintained by Our World in Data.

## Introduction

### Goal of the Analysis: 

The goal of this project is to showcase my expertise in data analytics, programming, and data visualization. Using Python for data analysis and Excel for dashboard creation, I aim to uncover valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic.

The main focus of this analysis will be addressing key unknown factors to understand the global and regional dynamics of COVID-19, its impact on healthcare systems, the effectiveness of public health measures, and potential predictive patterns.

This analysis will address eight key questions to elucidate the global and regional dynamics of COVID-19, its impact on healthcare systems, the effectiveness of public health measures, and potential predictive patterns. These questions are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's progression and influence.


	•	What are the trends of total cases and deaths globally over time?
	•	Which countries have the highest total cases and deaths (top 3)?
	•	How do total cases and deaths per million population vary across different regions (top 10)
	•	How many ICU patients and hospitalized patients are there?
 
 #### Key Observations on Global Trends of Total Cases and Deaths by Month

The plot shows global trends in total COVID-19 cases and deaths by month from January 2020 to July 2024.



1. **Total Cases (Blue Line)**:
   - Rapid increase from early 2020 to mid-2021.
   - Stabilized from mid-2021 onwards with minor fluctuations.
   - Sharp drop in July 2024, possibly a reporting anomaly or significant decrease in new cases.

2. **Total Deaths (Red Line)**:
   - Remain low and stable throughout the period.
   - No sharp drop at the end, unlike total cases.

#### General Interpretation

- **Initial Surge**: Reflects the pandemic's rapid global spread.
- **Stabilization**: Indicates the impact of public health measures and vaccination.
- **Low Death Rate**: Suggests effective treatments and better healthcare responses over time.

#### Conclusion

The plot highlights the pandemic's trajectory, showing an initial surge, subsequent stabilization, and a consistently low death rate, indicating effective global health interventions.
