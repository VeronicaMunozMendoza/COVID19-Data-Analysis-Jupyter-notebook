# PROJECT DETAILS

### Author: Veronica Munoz Mendoza

### Project Summary: 
This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a COVID-19 dataset using Python. 
The insights derived from the analysis will be utilised to create a comprehensive dashboard in Excel.

**Tools:**

	•	VS Code
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Excel

**Source:** The COVID-19 dataset is maintained by Our World in Data.

## Introduction

### Goal of the Analysis: 

The objective of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in data analytics, programming, and data visualisation. By leveraging Python for data analysis and Excel for dashboard creation, I aim to provide valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic.

The main focus of this analysis will be addressing key unknown factors to understand the global and regional dynamics of COVID-19, its impact on healthcare systems, the effectiveness of public health measures, and potential predictive patterns.

This analysis will address the following key questions, total of 8 to understand the global and regional dynamics of COVID-19, its impact on healthcare systems, the effectiveness of public health measures, and potential predictive patterns:

Global Trends:

	•	What are the trends of total cases and deaths globally over time?

Regional Comparison:

	•	Which continents/countries have the highest total cases and deaths?
	•	How do total cases and deaths per million population vary across different regions?

Healthcare System Impact:

	•	How many ICU patients and hospitalised patients are there over time?

Per Million Metrics:

	•	How do ICU patients per million and hospital patients per million vary across different regions?

Reproduction Rate Analysis:

	•	How has the reproduction rate (R) of the virus varied over time and across different regions?

Excess Mortality Investigation:

	•	How does excess mortality vary across different countries and continents?

Predictive Analysis:

	•	Can we predict future trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths using time series forecasting techniques?
	•	can we predict if somewhere is going to get covid based on attributes in the dataset??

The final phase will involve creating visualisations and interactive elements in an Excel dashboard to enhance the accessibility and usability of these insights for various stakeholders.
